# Text Processing and Statistical Analysis Project

## Overview

This Java project performs text processing and statistical analysis on text files. The project allows users to remove stop words from a text file, calculate basic statistics like word count and sentence count, and rank words by their frequency.

## Why This Project Is Useful
The project is useful for:
- Cleaning and preparing textual data by eliminating common stop words.
- Providing insights into the structure of text with word and sentence counts.
- Offering an easy way to analyze word frequency, which can be helpful for understanding the most commonly used terms in a body of text.

## How to Get Started
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure that you have a Java development environment installed (e.g., JDK 8 or higher).
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, BlueJ).
4. Run the `main` class located in the `src/main` folder.
5. Follow the menu prompts to process text files and view statistics.

   
### Features:
- Remove stop words from a text file.
- Calculate the number of words and sentences in the text.
- Rank words by their frequency.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main components:

1. **`main.Main`**: The main class that drives the program. It handles the user interface and calls the appropriate methods based on user input.
2. **`textProcessor.textProcessor`**: Handles file reading and stop word removal.
3. **`statisticCalculator.statisticCalculator`**: Handles calculating word count, sentence count, and word frequency.
   
 
## Usage Instructions
1. Place your text files in the appropriate directory.
2. Modify the file paths in the code as needed for your environment.
3. Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to process your files.
