## Overview

This Java project performs text processing and statistical analysis on text files. The project allows users to remove stop words from a text file, calculate basic statistics like word count and sentence count, and rank words by their frequency.

## Why This Project Is Useful
The project is useful for:
- Cleaning and preparing textual data by eliminating common stop words.
- Providing insights into the structure of text with word and sentence counts.
- Offering an easy way to analyze word frequency, which can be helpful for understanding the most commonly used terms in a body of text.

### Features:
- Remove stop words from a text file.
- Calculate the number of words and sentences in the text.
- Rank words by their frequency.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main components:

1. **`main.Main`**: The main class that drives the program. It handles the user interface and calls the appropriate methods based on user input.
2. **`textProcessor.textProcessor`**: Handles file reading and stop word removal.
3. **`statisticCalculator.statisticCalculator`**: Handles calculating word count, sentence count, and word frequency.
   
 
## Usage Instructions
1. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, BlueJ).
2. Run the `main` class located in the `src/main` folder.
3.  Place your text files in the appropriate directory.
4. Modify the file paths in the code as needed for your environment.
5. Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to process your files.
